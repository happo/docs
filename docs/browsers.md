Happo supports a number of different web browsers. If you think some browser is
missing, reach out to us at support@happo.io and we'll consider adding it to
the mix.

We keep these browsers up-to-date on a regular basis, and we try to keep them at
the latest versions. In some cases though, we might have to stick with a slightly
older version. If we for instance can't get newer browser versions to perform
well, we'll hold off on making the update until we've figured out a way to
adjust for the performance hit.
