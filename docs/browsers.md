Happo supports a number of different web browsers. If you see one you're
missing, reach out to us at support@happo.io and we might be able to add it to
the mix.

We keep these browsers up-to-date on a regular basis, and we try to keep them
at the latest versions. In some cases though, we might have to keep with a
slightly older version. If we for instance can't get newer browser versions to
perform well, we'll often hold off on making the update until we've figured out
a way to adjust for the performance hit.
