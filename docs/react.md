This page outlines how to integrate Happo with an existing React codebase.

## Installation

First, install the `happo.io` module:

```bash
npm install --save-dev happo.io
```

The React integration for Happo depends on `webpack`, `@babel/core` and
`babel-loader` as well. If you don't already have them installed, you need to
add them.

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack @babel/core babel-loader
```

# Adding test files

Before you can run your test suite, you need to define one or more component
example files.

Let's assume there's a `<Button>` component that we're adding examples for.
First, create a file called `Button-happo.js` and save it next to your
`Button.js` file (if this doesn't match your naming scheme you can use the
[`include`](#include) option). Add a few exports to this file (yes, you can use
ES6 here):

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Button from './Button';

export const primary = () => <Button type="primary">Primary</Button>;
export const secondary = () => <Button type="secondary">Secondary</Button>;
```

Then, we need to add some configuration. API tokens are used to authenticate
you with the remote happo.io service: `apiKey` and `apiSecret`. These can be
found on [your account page](https://happo.io/account). You also need to tell
happo what browsers you want to target. In this example, we're using two
Chrome targets. One at 1024 x 768 screen ("desktop") and one on a 320 x 640
screen ("mobile").

```js
// .happo.js
const { RemoteBrowserTarget } = require('happo.io');

module.exports = {
  apiKey: process.env.HAPPO_API_KEY,
  apiSecret: process.env.HAPPO_API_SECRET,

  targets: {
    'chrome-desktop': new RemoteBrowserTarget('chrome', {
      viewport: '1024x768',
    }),
    'chrome-mobile': new RemoteBrowserTarget('chrome', {
      viewport: '320x640',
    }),
  },
};
```

Save this file as `.happo.js`in the root folder of your project.

Once we're done with the configuration it's time to try things out. Before we
do that, let's add a `script` to our `package.json` file so that it's easier to
invoke commands:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "happo": "happo"
  }
}
```

This will expose a `happo` script we can run with

```bash
npm run happo run
```

Go ahead and run that command now.

If things are successful, you'll see something like this at the end of the run:

```
Uploading report for h5a4p3p2o1...
View results at https://happo.io/a/28/report/h5a4p3p2o1
Done h5a4p3p2o1
```

This first run will serve as our baseline. But now we need something to compare
that baseline with. A good way to test the whole flow is to make a change to a
component example and verify that happo will catch that difference. Open one of
your `*-happo.js` files and make some changes, e.g.

```js
export const primary = () => <Button type="primary">PRIMARY</Button>;
export const secondary = () => <Button type="secondary">Secondary</Button>;
export const tertiary = () => <Button type="tertiary">Tertiary</Button>;
```

Here, we made primary button have ALL CAPS and added a `tertiary` variant.

Let's run happo a second time:

```bash
npm run happo run
```

This time, we'll get a different hash:

```
Uploading report for h1a2p3p4o5...
View results at https://happo.io/a/28/report/h1a2p3p4o5
Done h1a2p3p4o5
```

Once the second run is done, we can compare the two runs by passing both hashes
to the `happo compare` action:

```bash
$ npm run --silent happo compare h5a4p3p2o1 h1a2p3p4o5
Differences were found.

- 2 diffs
- 2 added examples
- 2 unchanged examples

https://happo.io/a/28/compare/h5a4p3p2o1/h1a2p3p4o5

â†’ exit status: 1
```

Don't worry about the command failing with a non-zero exit code. This is by
design, scripts use the exit code as a signal that there is a diff.

If you open this URL in a browser, you'll see something like this:

<img src="/img/happo-report.png" alt="Happo report page" width="350" />

We've now covered the most important steps and commands involved in making a
full happo run. Normally, you won't run all these commands locally. Instead,
you'll configure your CI environment to do it for you, on every
PR/commit/branch pushed. When you're ready, jump ahead to the
[Continuous Integration](continuous-integration.md) section.

## Conditionally applied stylesheets

An example may conditionally apply styles from certain
[`stylesheets`](configuration.md) by using a `stylesheets` array:

```js
// Button-happo.js
export default () => {
  render: () => <Button>Submit</Button>,
  stylesheets: ['main', 'secondary'],
}
```

The strings in the array need to match `id`s of [`stylesheets`](#stylesheets)
defined in `.happo.js` config.

## Limiting targets

If you want to avoid rendering an example in all targets, you can use a
`targets` array defined for an example. The example will then be rendered in
the specified targets exclusively.

```jsx
export default () => {
  render: () => <Button>Submit</Button>,
  targets: ['chrome-small'],
}
```

The target strings in the array need to match [target keys](#targets) in
`.happo.js` config.

## Generated examples

If you want to group multiple components in one file you can export an array
instead, with objects defining the component and its variants. This can be
handy if you for some reason want to auto-generate happo examples from another
source (e.g. a style-guide, a component gallery etc).

```jsx
export default [
  {
    component: 'Button',
    variants: {
      primary: () => <Button type="primary">Primary</Button>,
      secondary: () => <Button type="secondary">Secondary</Button>,
    },
  },
  {
    component: 'Icon',
    variants: {
      small: () => <Icon size="small" />,
      large: () => <Icon size="large" />,
    },
  },
];
```

## Asynchronous examples

If you have examples that won't look right on the initial render, you can
return a promise from the example function. Happo will then wait for the
promise to resolve before it uses the markup in the DOM. This is useful if you
for instance have components that have some internal state that's hard to reach
without interacting with the component. To simplify rendering to the DOM, Happo
provides you with a function as the first argument to the example function.
When `type` is `react`, this function is a wrapper around `ReactDOM.render`.
When `type` is `plain`, this function is a simple `element.innerHTML` call,
returning a root element where that html got injected.

```jsx
// React example
export const asyncComponent = (renderInDom) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const component = renderInDom(<Foo />);
    component.doSomethingAsync(resolve);
  });
};
```

```js
// Plain js example
export const asyncComponent = (renderInDom) => {
  const rootElement = renderInDOM('<div>Loading...</div>');
  return doSomethingAsync().then(() => {
    rootElement.querySelector('div').innerHTML = 'Done!';
  });
};
```

You can use `async`/`await` here as well:

```jsx
export const asyncComponent = async (renderInDom) => {
  const component = renderInDom(<Foo />);
  await component.doSomethingAsync();
  component.doSomethingSync();
};
```

Be careful about overusing async rendering as it has a tendency to lead to a
more complicated setup. In many cases it's better to factor out a "view
component" which you render synchronously in the Happo test.
